    "text": "Overview\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that unifies and extends the R Markdown ecosystem. This session features five speakers who have been using and teaching R Markdown over the last decade and who have adopted Quarto over the last two years. The speakers will share their experiences teaching Quarto to students in a wide range of courses that span from first-year introductory data science to Master’s level statistical computing courses. The talks will also touch on multiple languages and tools as these courses teach R and Python using both RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks. The educators will also discuss building course materials with Quarto, using Quarto for standardizing and organizing student work, as well as for academic authoring broadly. The session will conclude with a discussion on the importance of teaching reproducible computing early and often as well as tips for educators for adopting and teaching new tools and technologies in a constantly evolving landscape.\nSession organizer: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel - Duke University + Posit\nSession chair: Allison Theobold - Cal Poly"

    "text": "Quarto, the next-generation version of R Markdown, is a powerful tool that helps students be more of an active participant in class while simultaneously highlighting the importance of reproducibility in science. In this talk, we discuss how to facilitate the use of Quarto into classroom pedagogy for students who are learning the programming language R and Quarto at the same time. In combination with R, this tool can help instructions create interactive live-coding experiences for students. Features of Quarto provide multiple ways for students to write code and type written answers to questions on their own, in groups, or along with the instructor during lecture. Students can also learn to create their own project reports, and turn their projects into hosted websites. In this session, we share how Quarto is used in an Introductory Data Science course for students with little to no coding experience at Duke University. Further, we go into benefits and challenges of teaching with Quarto from both the instructor and student perspective."

    "text": "Data science teams are increasingly “multilingual”, using more than one statistical computing tool for analyses and models. While many typesetting and notebook approaches support more than one language, Quarto is specifically designed for this flexibility. In particular, Quarto offers the ability to combine source code in both R and python into one single, reproducible document. These new capabilities have made it easier than ever to incorporate both languages simultaneously into statistics and data science courses. In this talk, I will give an overview of the advantages and drawbacks of using Quarto for “bilingual” materials in the data science classroom. I’ll also offer some tips and tricks - as well as some helper scripts - for managing these blended documents."

Mine’s work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM. Mine works on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. Mine works on the OpenIntro project, whose mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education. As part of this project she co-authored four open-source introductory statistics textbooks. She is also the creator and maintainer of datasciencebox.org and she teaches the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera. Mine is a Fellow of the ASA and Elected Member of the ISI as well as the winner of the 2021 Robert V. Hogg Award for For Excellence in Teaching Introductory Statistics. In 2023, she is the Chair of the ASA Section on Statistical Computing."
