    "text": "Quarto, the next-generation version of R Markdown, is a powerful tool that helps students be more of an active participant in class while simultaneously highlighting the importance of reproducibility in science. In this talk, we discuss how to facilitate the use of Quarto into classroom pedagogy for students who are learning the programming language R and Quarto at the same time. In combination with R, this tool can help instructions create interactive live-coding experiences for students. Features of Quarto provide multiple ways for students to write code and type written answers to questions on their own, in groups, or along with the instructor during lecture. Students can also learn to create their own project reports, and turn their projects into hosted websites. In this session, we share how Quarto is used in an Introductory Data Science course for students with little to no coding experience at Duke University. Further, we go into benefits and challenges of teaching with Quarto from both the instructor and student perspective."

This session features five speakers who have been using and teaching R Markdown over the last decade and who have adopted Quarto over the last two years. The speakers will share their experiences teaching Quarto to students in a wide range of courses that span from first-year introductory data science to Master’s level statistical computing courses. The talks will also touch on multiple languages and tools as these courses teach R and Python using both RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks. The educators will also discuss building course materials with Quarto, using Quarto for standardizing and organizing student work, as well as for academic authoring broadly. The session will conclude with a discussion on the importance of teaching reproducible computing early and often as well as tips for educators for adopting and teaching new tools and technologies in a constantly evolving landscape.\nSession organizer: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel - Duke University + Posit\nSession chair: Allison Theobold - Cal Poly"
