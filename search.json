    "text": "Overview\nQuarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that unifies and extends the R Markdown ecosystem. This session features five speakers who have been using and teaching R Markdown over the last decade and who have adopted Quarto over the last two years. The speakers will share their experiences teaching Quarto to students in a wide range of courses that span from first-year introductory data science to Master’s level statistical computing courses. The talks will also touch on multiple languages and tools as these courses teach R and Python using both RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks. The educators will also discuss building course materials with Quarto, using Quarto for standardizing and organizing student work, as well as for academic authoring broadly. The session will conclude with a discussion on the importance of teaching reproducible computing early and often as well as tips for educators for adopting and teaching new tools and technologies in a constantly evolving landscape.\nSession organizer: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel - Duke University + Posit\nSession chair: Allison Theobold - Cal Poly"

While many typesetting and notebook approaches support more than one language, Quarto is specifically designed for this flexibility. In particular, Quarto offers the ability to combine source code in both R and python into one single, reproducible document. These new capabilities have made it easier than ever to incorporate both languages simultaneously into statistics and data science courses.
